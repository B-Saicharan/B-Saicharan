Industrial Manufacturing and Production Internship
Project : Quality Prediction in a Mining Process
Prepared by
[Bandipelli Saicharan]


Executive Summary
This report provides details of the Industrial Manufacturing and Production Internship
 provided by upskill Campus and The IoT Academy in collaboration with Industrial Partner UniConverge Technologies Pvt Ltd (UCT).

This internship was focused on a project statement provided by UCT. We had to finish the project including the report in 6 weeksâ€™ time.

My project was (Quality Prediction in a Mining Process
 )
The "Quality Prediction in a Mining Process" project aims to utilize real industrial data, specifically from a flotation plant, to predict the percentage of impurity, specifically silica, in the ore concentrate. By forecasting silica levels, engineers can proactively take corrective actions to optimize ore quality and reduce environmental impact.

This internship gave me a very good opportunity to get exposure to Industrial problems and design/implement solution for that. It was an overall great experience to have this internship.
